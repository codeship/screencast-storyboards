Deploying Rails from GitHub to Heroku
======================

In this screencast we're gonna deploy a Ruby on Rails application from a GitHub repository to Heroku using the Codeship.

I've got a simple Ruby on Rails application called (`codefish`)[https://github.com/codeship-tutorials/codefish-rails] which contains some RSpec examples.

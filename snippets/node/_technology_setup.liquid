The Codeship suggests Node.js 0.10.18, but you can use whatever Node version you like. If you're unsure about the Node version of your project, type `node -v` in the Terminal.

Just copy your Node version into the `nvm install` and `nvm use` statements.

Additionally to our node modules, we need to install `jasmine-node` globally to be able to run our {{ tests }}. [add `npm install -g jasmine-node` after `npm install`]

We don't need `npm test` for our {{ tests }}, so let's comment it. Instead, we want to run `jasmine-node spec`. [add `jasmine-node spec` after commented `npm test`]

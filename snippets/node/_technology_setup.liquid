We've got our node modules in our repository, so we don't need to install them, but we need to install `jasmine-node` to be able to run our {{ tests }}. Let's install it globally. [change `npm install` to `npm install -g jasmine-node`]

To run our tests we don't need `npm test`, so let's comment it. Instead, we want to run `jasmine-node spec`. [add `jasmine-node spec` after commented `npm test`]

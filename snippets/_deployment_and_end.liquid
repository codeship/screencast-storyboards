Now let's save our deployment configuration.

From now on the Codeship will deploy our application to {{ deployment }} everytime we push to our {{ repository }} repository. Now let's push a change and see if it gets deployed. I add a paragraph "I just deployed my {{ technology }} app with the Codeship." to the landing page.

I commit and push the change

and immediately another build starts running on the Codeship. Let's go back to our project overview. I will fast-forward until the build is finished.

After the commands we already know from our first build, our application also gets deployed to Heroku now.

And about 2 minutes later our application is online.

When we open http://codefish-rails.herokuapp.com/ now, our deployed application appears.

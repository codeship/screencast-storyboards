Before we can configure our App Engine deployment, we need to connect our App Engine account to Codeship.

[Click "Connect to App Engine"]

![App Engine OAuth dialog][screenshot-deployment-oauth]

Let's accept the connection.

When we select "App Engine" again, we can configure our deployment.

![Empty App Engine deployment][screenshot-empty-deployment]

We can leave the path as it is, but I'd like to enter the URL to our application.

So let's create an application on App Engine.

![App Engine home page][screenshot-deployment-home-page]

[go to appengine.google.com and click "create application"]

I enter "{{ app_name }}" as identifier and "Codefish" as application name and I create the application.

![Creating an App Engine app][screenshot-new-deployment-app]

[close App Engine tab]

Now I can enter my application URL `http://{{ app_url }}` into my deployment configuration. This way the Codeship can check if my application works after deployment.

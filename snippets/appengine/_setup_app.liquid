Before we can configure our App engine deployment, we need to connect our AppEngine account to Codeship.

[Click "Connect to App engine"]

Let's accept the connection.

When we select "App engine" again, we can configure our deployment.

![Empty App Engine deployment][screenshot-empty-deployment]

We can leave the path as it is, but I'd like to enter the URL to our application.

So let's create an application on App engine.

![App engine home page][screenshot-deployment-home-page]

[go to appengine.google.com and click "create application"]

I enter "my-codefish" as identifier and "Codefish" as application name. Now I accept the terms and create the application.

![Creating an app engine app][screenshot-new-deployment-app]

[close app engine tab]

Now I can enter my application URL `http://my-codefish.appspot.com` into my deployment configuration. This way the Codeship can check if my application works after deployment.

Before we can configure our App Engine deployment, we need to connect our App Engine account to Codeship.

[Click "Connect to App Engine"]

![App Engine OAuth dialog][screenshot-deployment-oauth]

Let's accept the connection.

When we select "App Engine" again, we can configure our deployment.

![Empty App Engine deployment][screenshot-empty-deployment]

We can leave the path as it is, but I'd like to enter the URL to our application.

So let's create an application on App Engine.

![App Engine home page][screenshot-deployment-home-page]

[go to appengine.google.com and click "create application"]

I enter "{{ app_name }}" as identifier and "Codefish" as application name and I create the application.

![Creating an App Engine app][screenshot-new-deployment-app]

[close App Engine tab]

Now I can enter my application URL `http://{{ app_url }}` into my deployment configuration. This way the Codeship can check if my application works after deployment.

Before you can configure your App Engine deployment, you need to connect your App Engine account to Codeship by clicking the "Connect to App Engine" link.

![App Engine OAuth dialog][screenshot-deployment-oauth]

Let's accept the connection.

When you select "App Engine" again now, you can configure your deployment.

![Empty App Engine deployment][screenshot-empty-deployment]

You can leave the path as it is, but if you'd like the Codeship to check if your deployment worked, you should insert the URL of your application.

So let's go to [appengine.google.com](https://appengine.google.com) and create your application first.

![App Engine home page][screenshot-deployment-home-page]

There you need to enter an identifier for your app (in my case "{{ app_name }}") and a title (in my case "Codefish") and create the application.

![Creating an App Engine app][screenshot-new-deployment-app]

Now you can enter your application URL `http://YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER.appspot.com` into your deployment configuration.

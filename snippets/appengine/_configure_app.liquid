Let's get our application ready for App Engine. We create a file `app.yml` in the root directory of our application. In this configuration file we tell App Engine that our web application is called "my-codefish" and that it is a python app.

We say that the version is "1" and the api version is "1" as well. And finally we add a handler for all urls to be handled by `django_bootstrap.py`.

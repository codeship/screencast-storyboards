Let's get our application ready for App Engine. We create a file `app.yml` in the root directory of our application. In this configuration file we tell App Engine that our web application is called "my-codefish" and that it is a python app.

We say that the version is "1" and the api version is "1" as well. And finally we add a handler for all urls to be handled by `django_bootstrap.py`.

Let's get your application ready for App Engine by creating a file `app.yml` in the root directory of your application. In this configuration file you tell App Engine your web application's identifier (in my case "{{ app_name }}") and that it is a python app.

App engine also requires a `version` and an `api_version` parameter, which you can both set to "1". And finally add a handler for all urls to be handled by your app boot script, in my case `django_bootstrap.py`.

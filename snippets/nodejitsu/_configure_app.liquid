We still need to tell Nodejitsu which subdomain we want to deploy to and how to run our application.

In our `package.json` file we add `"subdomain": "codefish"` and a `"start"` script `"node start.js"`.

![Add Nodejitsu config][screenshot-add-deployment-config]

This way Nodejitsu will know where to publish our app and how to launch it.

I commit and push this change

![Commit and push Nodejitsu config][screenshot-commit-and-push-deployment-config]

In my case, I added `"subdomain": "codefish"` and a `"start"` script `"node start.js"`. Please adapt these parameters to whatever fits your app.

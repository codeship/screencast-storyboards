We can leave the setup commands as they are. We want to install our dependencies from the `requirements.txt`. Our application doesn't need a database, so we can leave the database setup commands commented out.

[scroll to test commands]

We don't have to change the test commands either as our tests can be run with `python manage.py test`.

For my application I don't use a database, so I leave the setup commands as they are. If you want to run the `syncdb` or the `migrate` command for your application, just uncomment the commands by removing the `#` in front of them.

If you want to run your tests with `python manage.py test`, you don't need to change the test commands. Otherwise just enter your own test commands.

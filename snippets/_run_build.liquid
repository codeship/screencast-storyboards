By the way, if you ever need help, check out the Codeship documentation. [move mouse over documentation link] If you encounter any problems, contact the Codeship crew by clicking on the support links in the top-right or the bottom-right corner. [move mouse over support links]

And a few seconds later our build succeeded! Great!

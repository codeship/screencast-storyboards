The first step of our project setup is to select {{ repository }} as our repository provider.

![Repo provider selection {{ repository }}][screenshot-repo-provider-selection]

In the list of my {{ repository }} repositories

![Repo selection {{ repository }}][screenshot-repo-selection]

I search for my repo "{{ repo_name }}" and select it.

![Repo selection {{ repository }} filtered][screenshot-repo-selection-filtered]

Now our repository is connected and we can set up our test commands:

![Codeship welcome screen][screenshot-codeship-technology]

We select "{{ technology }}" as our framework. This prepopulates the setup commands and the test commands for us.

![Codeship Technology {{ technology }}][screenshot-codeship-technology-{{ repository_slug }}]

The first step of your project setup is to select {{ repository }} as your repository provider.

[![Select your repository provider][screenshot-repo-provider-selection]][screenshot-repo-provider-selection]

In the list of your {{ repository }} repositories

[![Search for your repository in the list][screenshot-repo-selection]][screenshot-repo-selection]

search for the repository you want to set up and select it. In my case I search for "codefish".

[![Find your repository in the filtered list][screenshot-repo-selection-filtered]][screenshot-repo-selection-filtered]

Now your repository is connected and you can set up your test commands:

[![Set up your test commands][screenshot-codeship-technology]][screenshot-codeship-technology]

Codefish is a {{ technology }} application. So I choose "{{ technology }}" as my framework. This prepopulates the setup commands and the test commands for you.

[![Select {{ technology }} as your technology][screenshot-codeship-technology-selected]][screenshot-codeship-technology-selected]

Tips
- Do not move mouse if not absolutely necessary
- Move slowly while recording the screen; Can be sped up later on, but less errors
- Cut from end to beginning, as best parts are recorded on the last try so you can easily remove earlier ones
- Add freeze frames to make video fit audio
- Wait for spinner or other visual elemens to finish before moving the mouse again. These can be cut out later then

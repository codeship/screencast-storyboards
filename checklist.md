Before recording the screencast:

- Log into separate user
- Make sure you can access the repo. (e.g, git pull)
- Reset repo to starting point (git reset --hard) for tutorial, Force push to repo to reset the Github repository.
- Log in at repository provider
- Revoke authentication at repository provider and deployment provider
- Log in with User account (bitbucket and github account as project can be in either of them) and remove all projects
- Log in at deployment provider
- Remove App at deployment provider (Heroku,â€¦)
- Ensure at least 10 GB free hard disk space.
- Set display resolution to 1280 x 800.
- Open 3 windows (fullscreen on different panes)
    1) Browser (open file view in repository on github or bitbucket; Only this tab should be opened)
    2) Terminal (clear terminal)
    3) Editor (close files in editor)
- Reset browser history, but keep cached assets and cookies

- Let build run once (to activate dependency cache)
- Reset repo soft and force push
- Delete all builds and reset road to success

Tips
- Do not move mouse if not absolutely necessary
- Move slowly while recording the screen; Can be sped up later on, but less errors
- Cut from end to beginning, as best parts are recorded on the last try so you can easily remove earlier ones
